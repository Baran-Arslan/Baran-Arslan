Hello, my name is Baran and I am 23 years old. I have over 5 years of experience in game development using Unity.
During this time, I have created a variety of games ranging from complex open-world games to hyper-casual games. 
My passion for game development has driven me to constantly improve my skills and explore new technologies to enhance the gaming experience for players.
Currently, I am also pursuing a degree in computer engineering at the Poland Warsaw Management University. 
This academic background, coupled with my practical experience in game development, has equipped me with a unique skill set that allows me to tackle complex 
challenges in game development.

I take pride in my ability to work well in teams, as well as independently, 
and i am always willing to go the extra mile to ensure the success of any project i am involved in.
I am confident that my passion, experience, and dedication to game development will make me a valuable asset to any team.

Thank you for your consideration.
